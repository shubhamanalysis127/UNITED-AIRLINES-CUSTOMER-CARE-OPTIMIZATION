## **Call Center Analysis and Optimization Project**

### **Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze call center data to identify inefficiencies and suggest improvements to enhance customer satisfaction and operational performance. By examining factors like Average Handling Time (AHT), Average Speed of Answer (AST), and call transcript analysis, the project provides actionable insights for optimizing call center operations.

### **Key Objectives**

1. **Identify key drivers of high AHT and AST.**
2. **Pinpoint self-solvable issues for automated resolution.**
3. **Categorize primary call reasons for effective call routing.**

### **Methodology**

1. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:**
   - Load and clean call center datasets.
   - Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Perform initial analysis of call volumes, durations, and handling times.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct descriptive analysis to calculate metrics like average AHT and call frequency.
   - Analyze correlations between call types, agent performance, and call handling times.

3. **Text Analysis & Clustering:**
   - Use TF-IDF Vectorization to convert call transcripts into numerical data.
   - Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
   - Implement K-Means Clustering to categorize call transcripts into distinct clusters.

4. **Machine Learning for Predictive Modeling:**
   - Develop a predictive model to categorize call reasons using the trained clustering model.
   - Identify patterns and suggest improvements in call routing and handling.

5. **Recommendation Development:**
   - Analyze call patterns to identify self-solvable issues.
   - Propose actionable recommendations to streamline call handling, reduce agent intervention, and optimize performance.

### **Technologies & Tools**

- **Python:** Programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Library for numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn:** Library for machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Libraries for data visualization.
